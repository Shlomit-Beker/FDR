# FDR
False Discovery Rate - different methods
The codes under this folder correct for FDR (multiple comparisons) using two different methods:
1. Guthrie-Buchwald (As in Guthrie-Buchwald, 1991) - by comparing the size of significant clusters.
2. Cluster-based permutation test (as in Mike X. Cohen, 2014). 
Of note, the last approach is more stringent than the first, and more recent.
